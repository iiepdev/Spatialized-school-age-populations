# Spatialized school age populations
 
This is the package related to the IIEP (2021, forthcoming) paper "Estimating school-age populations by applying Sprague multipliers to raster data". 
This methodology uses Sprague multipliers (Sprague, 1880) to interpolate data and obtain population estimates by single years of age for different administrative boundaries (polygons), that are then reassembled according to any official school-age groups for any territory. 

This approach can be applied to other types of polygons, any country or administrative division, by simply changing the corresponding population estimates' raster files, and changing the names to the territory in question. The methodology is illustrated with Bangladesh, and robustness checks are performed on Canada, Colombia, Rwanda, Seychelles, and Uganda. 

To allow for maximum transparency and replicability, all supporting documents, calculations, codes, databases, and images are available to the public . This includes  commented Jupyter notebooks for all mentioned countries. In order to open the files included on these folders, the user will need to have QGIS 3.X installed on their computer, and Jupyter notebook to view the Robustness checks. The databases used can be downloaded from https://box.iiep.unesco.org/s/TkPrnQyXYr6Qtjd under the Data folder.
